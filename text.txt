Volunteers working to protect a rare mainland species of bord in Southland have recorded its best breeding season in years.

In the past 10 years the highest recording was just 30 t¨©t¨© (Sooty shearwater) chicks in a Bluff colony, but attempts to rid the area of pests meant this year the Bluff Hill Motup¨­hue Environment Trust recorded 45.

A new predator trap network installed on Bluff Hill last year is being hailed as the reason for the successful 50 per cent increase in chicks hatched at the colony this seeson.
